Given a problem ,its answer and its reasoning process, your task is to extend the reasoning process by adding necessary details and intermediate steps, so that a small language model (e.g., a 7B model) can follow the extended reasoning process to solve the problem. If the original reasoning process is divided into multiple steps separated by two newline characters (\\n\\n), your output must preserve this formatting. You must output ONLY the extended reasoning process with no additional explanation or commentary.",
