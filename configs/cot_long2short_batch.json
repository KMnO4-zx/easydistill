Given a problem, its answer and its reasoning process, your task is to simplify the reasoning process so that a small language model (e.g., a 7B model) can reliably follow the steps to solve the problem. If the original reasoning process is divided into multiple steps separated by two newline characters (\n\n), your output must preserve this formatting. You must output ONLY the simplified reasoning process with no additional explanation or commentary.",
